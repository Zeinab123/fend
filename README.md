# Project Title

Landing page.

## Description

This project is about a multi-section landing page. Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. 

## Getting Started


## Project specifications
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
Styling has been added for active states.
When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Help
TO open the source code you must have any text editor, sublime, for examble
